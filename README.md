# README
This is a **ipynb** file which [**JupyterLab**](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html) or [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb) can be use to do any edit.
1. Download the ipynb file and open on one of the two website or use [Visual Studio Jupyter Notebook extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
2. Make edit (each block can be raw text, md, or code(depending on the kernel you can use python, sql, or C++)).
3. On the file browser(left sidebar), right click to download the file and push it onto this repo somehow.

All wikis will be written in md/markdown format.
